# mate

A 24 hour sprint. Make a landing page for a passion project. I have no passion project atm and I also cannot run very fast, but here it is. 
The working name for this i Mate. A buddy, a gaming buddy. Its a board game community and seller for normal people, you know, cuz us boardgamers can be quite scary.

For some reason it does not work at all in Safari, good thing I debugg in Chrome. That's a problem for future-Linn√©a to fix. Right now, please just look at it in chrome on a desktop, ok?
